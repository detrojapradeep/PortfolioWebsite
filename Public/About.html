    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
    👨‍💻 As a motivated graduate in M.Sc. Advanced Computer Science at the University of Sheffield, I am deeply passionate about the world of software development. My journey in the field has been marked by, and not limited to, MERN web technologies
    <br>🚀 During my project internship at the Space Applications Centre (ISRO), I had the opportunity to contribute to a transformative project, digitizing IT component infrastructure and honing my skills in full-stack development and agile methodologies. This experience allowed me to play a key role in designing scalable databases and frontend solutions
    <br>🌟 In addition to my academic and professional endeavors, I am immensely proud of my role as President of JU Makerspace, where I led impactful social-impact projects, including providing essential support during the pandemic. This experience strengthened my leadership and interpersonal skills and allowed me to make a significant impact in the student community
    <br>💡 With a strong foundation in both hard and soft skills, I am committed to leveraging technology to drive positive change. I'm excited to continue my journey in the software industry, contributing to innovative projects and making a meaningful difference
